🌱 Smart Self-Watering Plant Care System

An eco-friendly, automated plant care solution designed to optimize indoor plant maintenance with minimal user intervention. This system leverages IoT technology, real-time data analytics, and cloud connectivity to create an intelligent self-watering system.
🚀 Features

    Automated Watering: Adjusts schedules based on soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and weather forecasts.

    IoT & Cloud Integration: Uses Raspberry Pi Pico W, MQTT protocol, and MongoDB for real-time data storage and retrieval.

    Smart Decision Making: Backend (Node.js & Express.js) integrates real-time and forecasted weather data for optimized watering.

    User-Friendly Interface: Mobile-optimized web app with NFC-based plant registration and manual pump control.

    Scalable & Modular: Designed for future expansion into both indoor and outdoor plant care applications.

🛠️ Tech Stack

    Hardware: Raspberry Pi Pico W, soil moisture sensors, temperature & humidity sensors, water level detectors.

    Backend: Node.js, Express.js, MQTT for real-time communication.

    Database: MongoDB (scalable storage for plant and environmental data).

    Frontend: Mobile-first web app with NFC-based plant identification.

📖 How It Works

    Sensors collect real-time environmental data.

    Data is transmitted to the cloud using MQTT and stored in MongoDB.

    The backend processes sensor data and weather forecasts to determine optimal watering.

    Users can monitor plants and manually control pumps through the web app.# plant-monitor
